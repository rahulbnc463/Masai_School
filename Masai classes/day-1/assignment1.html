      The i HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the
      normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms,
      taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been
      presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the i
      naming of this element.

    <h1>u tag</h1>
    <p>
      The u HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be
      rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation.
      This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be
      altered using CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
      The select HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of
      options.

    <h1>button</h1>
    <p>
      The button HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with

      a form or opening a dialog.
